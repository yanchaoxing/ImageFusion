Find the files GFCE.m and HMSD_GF.m in the folder "Context_Enhance_via_Fusion" to implement 
the proposed methods

GFCE.m ----- an implementation of the GFCE through fusion of infrared and visible images.

HMSD_GF.m ----- an implementation of the HMSD fusion method based on the guided filter (HMSD-GF)

If you use the codes, please cite the papers as follows:
